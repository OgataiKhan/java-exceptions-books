# Java Exceptions Books

This is an exercise intended to practice error handling in Java as well as writing to and reading from file.

The program will ask the user to create an array of books characterized by their title, author, page count, and publisher, while handling invalid inputs.  
It will then write the resulting array to a text file then read it from there and print it.
